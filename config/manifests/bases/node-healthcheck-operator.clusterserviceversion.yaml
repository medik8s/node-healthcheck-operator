    ### Introduction
    Hardware is imperfect, and software contains bugs. When node level failures such as kernel hangs or dead NICs
    occur, the work required from the cluster does not decrease - workloads from affected nodes need to be
    restarted somewhere.

    However some workloads, such as RWO volumes and StatefulSets, may require at-most-one semantics.
    Failures affecting these kind of workloads risk data loss and/or corruption if nodes (and the workloads
    running on them) are assumed to be dead whenever we stop hearing from them. For this reason it is important
    to know that the node has reached a safe state before initiating recovery of the workload.

    Unfortunately it is not always practical to require admin intervention in order to confirm the node’s true status.
    In order to automate the recovery of exclusive workloads, we provide operators for failure detection
    and remediation.

    ### Failure detection: Node Health Check operator
    The “Node Health Check” (NHC) operator checks each Node’s set of
    NodeConditions (eg. NotReady) against the criteria and thresholds defined in
    NodeHealthCheck configuration. If the Node is deemed to be in a failed
    state, NHC will initiate recovery by using the SIG Cluster API's “External
    Remediation” API to instantiate the configured remediation template which
    specifies the mechanism/controller to be used.

    ### Failure handling: Self Node Remediation
    By default NHC depends on the “Self Node Remediation” (SNR) operator, which
    is installed automatically.
    SNR uses watchdog timers and heuristics to ensure nodes enter a safe state
    (no longer hosting workloads) within a known and finite period of time,
    before signaling to the system that all Pods and VolumeAttachments on the
    failed Node are no longer active and can be relocated elsewhere.
    In the case of transient errors, the watchdog’s actions will also result in
    the node rebooting and rejoining the cluster - restoring capacity.
